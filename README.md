# DIP-Noise_Filters
## What is Noise?
#### Image noise is random variation of brightness or color information in images, and is usually an aspect of electronic noise. It can be produced by the image sensor and circuitry of a scanner or digital camera. Image noise can also originate in film grain and in the unavoidable shot noise of an ideal photon detector.

## What is filters in DIP?
#### Filtering is a technique for modifying or enhancing an image. For example, you can filter an image to emphasize certain features or remove other features. Image processing operations implemented with filtering include smoothing, sharpening, and edge enhancement.

## Why?
#### In image processing filters are mainly used to suppress either the high frequencies in the image, i.e. smoothing the image, or the low frequencies, i.e. enhancing or detecting edges in the image. An image can be filtered either in the frequency or in the spatial domain.
